            <p>I love looking at the different aspects and the aesthetic of life. 
                I like seeing how flowers bloom, how vast our nature and how deep our ocean, how the universe paint our sky with white clouds and with a pale tint of orange sunsets
                , how humans interact with each other in their day to day life and how hard and sophisticated life is. My passion is to live seeing all the beautiful things that surrounds me, 
                embracing the symphony of existence through joy and sorrow. </p>
